"""English-only names: drop the `_np`/`_romanized` columns, rename `_en` to bare.

The project is English-only. The bilingual `_np`/`_en`/`_romanized` triple
(CLAUDE.md §39.1 as it stood) modelled two canonical identities for one record;
with one language there is one name, and a `_en` suffix distinguishes nothing.

**Destructive.** The `_np` and `_romanized` columns are dropped and cannot be
recovered by reversing this migration — the reverse re-creates the columns
empty. The `RunPython` step below runs first and copies a `_np` value into the
surviving column wherever that column is blank, so a record whose only name was
Devanagari keeps a name rather than becoming nameless. Names already in English
are untouched.

Renames (not drop+add) carry the existing column data across.
